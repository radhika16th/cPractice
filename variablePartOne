  /*Create a int variable called a, then create an unsigned int variable called b, then create a short variable called c, and finally, create a unsigned short variable called d.

  Then you need to use a single printf statement to print all of these on the same line. 

  For integers, you use %d, you must google and figure out the command to print the other 3 types.*/
